# BestOCR
I am going to show you best OCR ever.

Optical character recognition (OCR) detects text in an image and extract the recognized words into a machine-readable character stream. Analyse images to detect embedded text, generate character streams and enable searching. Take photos of text instead of copying to save time and effort
I explored many OCR from different-2 MNCs and start-ups like Google, Microsoft, Tesseract and many more. I developed android app on each company OCR to check the feasibility and accuracy. I have tested these OCR s in different lighting environment than I saw many OCRs were failing when there is not proper lighting and proper environment even sometimes they were giving different language altogether while scanning English language. But at the end I found one OCR that is capable to work on dim light and also able to get all content from the image. The name of that OCR is Microsoft vision API.

This OCR can give you best result in dim lighting also.

This OCR app will help you to save your time while scanning the wifiPassword, 

and you may also can use this app to read business card,Expense reporting and auditing and many more.

You can use it as a Text Scanner app.

Help people so that they will not face the same problem as you face while coding.

Happy Coding :)

Following are the app screens.
